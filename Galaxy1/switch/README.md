This directory contains the text data from the Switch release of Galaxy 1, from Super Mario 3D All-Stars.

There's only an `all.json` file because this was mostly just a way to satisfy my curiosity,
and just having the single JSON file was more useful for me anyway.

The `comparisons.json` file is a file that lists out the results of checking if a string is
different between the original Wii version and the Switch version.
Most of the differences are just updating button icons and text changing from "Point at the screen"
to "Point with the Joy-Con or touch the screen". There are other things, like typo/spacing fixes
in various languages, but most of them are fairly mundane (like, the Latin American Spanish version
changing Cosmic Comet mission names from "¡Fantasma!" to "¡Corre, corre!").
There were also strings that were removed, but they were all basically unused
or were blank anyway. Nothing new was added between versions.
